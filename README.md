# MachineLearningEnsemble

Machine Learning classification using ensemble of GNB and DT models

1. Exploratory Data Analysis with Univariate and Multivariate analysis, with strategies to address data challenges esp. zero and unknown values, outliers etc.

2. Evaluation with standalone basic models - using Gaussian Naive Bayes and Decision Tree 

3. Evaluation comparison with Hyperparameter tuning on standalone models 

4. Ensemble Techniques - Bagging using Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier

5. Ensemble Techniques - Bagging using Random Forest

6. Ensemble Techniques - Adaboosting: With and without base estimators 

7. Ensemble Techniques - Gradient Boosting: With various combination of estimators, learning rate and max depth 

8. Inference on performance of various ensemble models
